ingredients:
  - 3 beetroot, scrubbed
  - 1 lemon, zested and juiced
  - 2 tbsp olive oil

  - 50 g goat's cheese, optional
  - 20 g walnuts, roughly chopped

  - ""
  - Trim away the ends of the beetroot then, using a mandoline or sharp knife,
    thinly slice into discs. Tip into a bowl and drizzle over half the lemon
    juice, half the olive oil and 1 tsp of the cider vinegar, then season well.
    Toss or mix together, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to marinate for
    20 mins-1 hr.
  - Make a dressing by combining the remaining lemon juice, olive oil, cider
    vinegar, honey and the Dijon mustard with a good pinch of salt and freshly
    ground black pepper.
  - Arrange the beetroot slices on a platter, slightly overlapped in a spiral
    pattern, then pile the rocket into the middle, leaving most of the beetroot
    on display. Drizzle over the dressing, crumble over the goat’s cheese, if
    using, and scatter with the chopped walnuts and lemon zest.
