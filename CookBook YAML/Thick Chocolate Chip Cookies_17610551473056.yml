ingredients:
  - ½ cup unsalted butter, room temperature
  - ¾ cup light brown sugar
  - ¼ cup white sugar
  - 1 large egg
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - 2 cups all purpose flour
  - ½ tsp salt
  - ½ tsp baking powder
  - ¾ cup semi sweet chocolate chips
  - ¼ cup chopped pecans, can be omitted
directions:
  - ""
  - Line a large baking sheet with a silicone baking mat, set aside.
  - In a large mixing bowl add the butter and sugars. Using a hand or stand
    mixer cream the butter and sugars together until fluffy.
  - Add in the large egg, vanilla and mix until combined.
  - Add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix until combined. The dough might
    seem to be in crumbles as mentioned above.
  - Pour in the chocolate chips and pecans (if using) and use your hands to mix
    them in. This will bring the dough together. Be gentle though. We don't want
    to compact the dough too much. We want to keep it as airy as possible.
  - Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Gently form into cookie form. Place on the
    baking sheet.
  - Chill the cookie dough for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375
    during this time.
  - Bake the cookies for about 16-18 minutes. The outside will be golden brown.
  - Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for at least 5 minutes, then remove
    to a wire rack to continue cooling. The cookies need to cool prior to
    serving. They are best at room temperature.
