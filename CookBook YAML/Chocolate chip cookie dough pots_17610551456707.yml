  - Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4, and measure the flour, salt and bicarb
    intoa bowl, forking together to mix. . With an electric mixer, or by hand,
    beat the butter and sugar until you have a lightand creamy mixture, then add
    the vanilla paste or extract and the egg, beatingagain to incorporate •
    Gently fold in the flour mixture, then, once it's all mixed in, fold in the
    chocolatechips.
  - Divide the dough between 6 ramekins (you will need about 472 tablespoonsof
    batter for each one). Using a small offset spatula (for ease) or the back of
    a teaspoon, spread the mixture to cover the bottom of the ramekins, and
    smooth the tops.
  - Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 13-15 minutes.
  - They will still be quite gooey inside, but the top will be set, and they
    should be golden brown at the edges and just beginning to come away from the
    sides of the ramekins. Leave to cool for 5-10 minutes before serving. You
    can spoon a scoop of ice cream on top of each one or serve with cream or
    crème fraîche on the side. They will set as they cool down, so don't dally
    now
