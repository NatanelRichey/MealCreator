  Make-Ahead: These are meant to be eaten when they are done cooking. However,
  you can keep this warm on a rack-lined cookie sheet tray in the oven at 165°
  for up to 30 minutes before serving.

  How to Store: Cover and store in the refrigerator for 4 to 5 days. You can
  freeze these covered for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator for 1 day
  before reheating.

  How to Reheat: Add the desired number of kibbehs to a sheet tray lined with
  parchment paper and bake at 350° for 6-8 minutes or until hot on the inside.

  You can use a combination of beef and lamb, but all lamb is traditional.

  If the outside shell ingredients in the food processor are too dry and not
  moving, add a few tablespoons of water. If it’s too wet, add some flour or
  corn starch.

  Be sure to have little bowls of water and or oil to dip your hands in before
  forming the kibbeh so the meat does not stick.

  There should be enough oil to cover half of the kibbeh while they’re cooking.

  If at any point the kibbeh is sticking to your hands at all, just lightly coat
  your hands in a little bit of cold water.

ingredients:
  - "Kibbeh shell:"
  - 1.5 cups cold water
  - 2 cups bulgur wheat
  - 450 g pound ground beef/lamb
  - 2 peeled and roughly chopped yellow onions
  - 1.5 tablespoons Lebanese 7 spice
  - 15 fresh basil leaves
  - 15 fresh mint leaves
  - 2 teaspoons sea salt
  - "Kibbeh filling:"
  - 2 tablespoons Olive oil
  - 2 peeled and small diced yellow onions
  - 450 g pound ground lamb
  - 1 tablespoon Lebanese 7 spice
  - 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
  - 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
  - salt to taste
  - 0.25 cup toasted pine nuts
  - 1 neutral-flavored oil for frying
directions:
  - ""
  - Pour the water over the bulgur wheat in a medium-size bowl just until
    covered. Mix and set aside for 15-20 minutes.
  - Next, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a large frying pan over low to
    medium heat and
  - add in the 2 small-diced onions and brown stirring occasionally, which takes
    about 20 minutes.
  - Turn the heat to high and add in the ground lamb and cook until lightly
    browned and cooked through out, which takes about 4-6 minutes. Stir often to
    break up into small pieces.
  - Stir in the spice blend, fresh basil, fresh mint, salt, and toasted pine
    nuts, and set aside.
  - Transfer the soaked bulgur wheat to a food processor along with the roughly
    chopped onions and pulse on high speed until the onions are finely minced.
  - Next, add in the ground lamb, spices, fresh herbs, and salt, and pulse on
    high speed until it becomes smooth.
  - Lightly dip your hands in some water and grab about a golf ball size of the
    processed meat and wheat and form to a ball.
  - Dip your thumb in some water and press in the center while rotating the meat
    with your other hand to form a hollow cone-like shape.
  - Spoon in some of the cooked lamb and caramelized onion mixture into the
    inside of the hollowed-out kibbeh shell.
  - Pull up the sides of the kibbeh shell and pinch the top.
  - Cupping your hands, roll the kibbeh to form a pointy cylinder-like shape or
    quenelle.
  - Repeat this process until all the ingredients have been used up and place
    them on a sheet tray lined with parchment paper.
  - Fry the kibbeh in batches in a pan of neutral flavored oil at 350° for 2 ½
    to 3 minutes per side or until golden brown and cooked throughout.
  - Drain on a rack lined cookie sheet tray.
  - Garnish with parsley and serve with optional garlic yogurt sauce.
