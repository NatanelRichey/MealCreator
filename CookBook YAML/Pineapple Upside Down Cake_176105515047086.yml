ingredients:
  - 1 Topping
  - 0.25 cup unsalted butter, melted, 4 Tbsp; 56g
  - 0.5 cup packed light or dark brown sugar, 100g
  - 1 8–10 pineapple slices *, see note
  - 15 –20 maraschino cherries *, see note
  - 1 Cake
  - 1.5 cups cake flour, 177g, spooned & leveled
  - 1 teaspoon baking powder
  - 0.25 teaspoon baking soda
  - 0.5 teaspoon salt
  - 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened to room temperature, 85g
  - 0.75 cup granulated sugar, 150g
  - 2 large egg whites, at room temperature
  - 0.33 cup sour cream, at room temperature, 80g
  - 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
  - 0.25 cup pineapple juice, at room temperature, 60ml, use leftover from can
  - 2 tablespoons milk, at room temperature, 30ml
directions:
  - ""
  - Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).
  - "Prepare topping first:"
  - Pour 1/4 cup melted butter into an ungreased 9×2 inch pie dish or round cake
    pan. Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over butter. Blot any excess liquid off the
    fruit with a clean towel or paper towel. Arrange about 6-7 blotted pineapple
    slices and all the cherries on top of the brown sugar. Place pan in the
    refrigerator for a few minutes as you prepare the cake batter.
  - "Make the cake batter:"
  - Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set
    aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer, beat the butter on high speed until
    smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat until creamed
    together, about 1 minute. Beat in the egg whites until combined, then beat
    in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet
    ingredients. Turn the mixer onto low speed and slowly pour in the pineapple
    juice and milk. Beat on low speed just until all of the ingredients are
    combined.
  - Remove topping from the refrigerator. Pour and spread cake batter evenly
    over topping.
  - Bake for 43-48 minutes, tenting foil on top of the cake halfway through bake
    time to prevent the top from over-browning. The cake is done when a
    toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean.
  - Remove cake from the oven and cool on a wire rack for just 20 minutes.
    Invert the slightly cooled cake onto a cake stand or serving plate. You can
    slice and serve the cake warm, but it’s best to cool the cake completely at
    room temperature before slicing and serving.
