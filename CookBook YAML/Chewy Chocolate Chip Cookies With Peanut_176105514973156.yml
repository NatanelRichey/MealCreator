name: Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies With Peanut Butter
description: These super soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies are the most
  popular cookie recipe on my website for good reason. Melted butter, more brown
  sugar than white sugar, cornstarch, and an extra egg yolk guarantee the
  absolute chewiest chocolate chip cookie texture. The cookie dough is slick and
  requires chilling prior to shaping the cookies. Review recipe notes before
  beginning.

ingredients:
  - 280 g all-purpose flour
  - 1 teaspoon baking soda
  - 1.5 teaspoons cornstarch
  - 0.5 teaspoon salt
  - 70 g refined coconut oil melted & cooled 5 minutes
  - 100 g peanut butter
  - 150 g packed light or dark brown sugar
  - 100 g granulated sugar
  - 1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature
  - 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
  - 100 g semi-sweet chocolate chips or chocolate chunks
directions:
  - ""
  - Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, and salt together in a large bowl.
    Set aside.
  - In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar
    together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Whisk in the egg and egg yolk.
    Finally, whisk in the vanilla extract. The mixture will be thin. Pour into
    dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The
    dough will be very soft, thick, and appear greasy. Fold in the chocolate
    chips. The chocolate chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted
    butter, but do your best to combine them.
  - Cover the dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator overnight for less
    spreading.
  - Take the dough out of the refrigerator and allow it to slightly soften at
    room temperature for 10 minutes.
  - Preheat oven to 163°C. Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or
    silicone baking mats. Set aside.
  - Weigh 50g of dough. Roll into a ball, making sure the shape is taller rather
    than wide—almost like a cylinder. This helps the cookies bake up thicker.
    Repeat with remaining dough. Place 8–9 balls of dough onto each cookie
    sheet.
  - Bake the cookies for 12–13 minutes or until the edges are very lightly
    browned. The centers will look very soft, but the cookies will continue to
    set as they cool. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, press
    a few extra chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is
    optional and only for looks. After 10 minutes of cooling on the baking
    sheets, transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
  - Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.
