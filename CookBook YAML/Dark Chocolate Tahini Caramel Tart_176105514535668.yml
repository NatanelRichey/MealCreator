    Here’s how,


    Heat oven to 350F. In a food processor or chopper, process the biscuits
    until crumbly. Mix with coconut oil until it feels like wet sand and firmly
    press into a 9inch tart pan all the way up the edges. Use the back of a
    measuring cup to get it nice and firm. Bake for 10 minutes to set. Remove
    and allow to cool.
  - In a frying pan, bring the sugar and water to a boil over medium high. Boil
    until the sugar melts and caramelizes into a deep golden amber. Remove from
    heat and carefully and vigorously stir in the cream. Wear a glove since
    it’ll steam and splatter. Continue stirring until well incorporated. Mix in
    the salt and tahini. Set aside to cool slightly. Pour the caramel over the
    crust. Refrigerate for at least 20 minutes.
  - Pour cream into a small saucepan and heat over medium high. When the sides
    start to bubble and the cream is hot but not boiling, add in the chocolate.
    Remove from heat and allow to stand for 5 minutes. Stir until the chocolate
    has melted into the cream. Carefully pour over the caramel and smooth out
    the top. Sprinkle Maldon salt. Return to the refrigerator to set for at
    least an hour.
  - Store the cake in the fridge, covered, for up to 10 days.
