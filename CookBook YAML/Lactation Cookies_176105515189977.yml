name: Lactation Cookies.
description: No, never did I ever think I would be typing “lactation” and
  “cookies” in the same sentence and especially not on my blog. But these are
  GOOD.
servings: 22 cookies depending on your scoop

notes: >-
  1. You can easily freeze this dough – scoop the rounds on a baking sheet,
  place the sheet in the freezer for 2 hours, then place the dough rounds in a
  ziplock bag and store in the freezer. Bake at the same temp – they may or may
  not need an extra minute or 2 – your preference!

  2. You can use all butter if you don’t have/can’t find coconut oil. If you
  swap any butter amount for more coconut oil, the cookies will spread a bit
  more. If you decrease the fat (butter/oil) amount in total, these cookies will
  be drier. It’s up to you!

  3. You can use 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour with similar results – any more
  and the cookies with be drier and grittier.

  4. You can probably decrease the sugar by 1/4 cup without issue.

  5. I do not have experience in making these vegan, so I can’t say what it
  would be like without the eggs or with vegan butter. I also am not sure how
  the consistency would be with gluten free flour.

  6. I personally think you can increase the brewers yeast amount by 1 to 2
  tablespoons.

  - Baked Goods
  - Cookies
ingredients:
  - 3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
  - 1.5 cups unbleached organic all-purpose flour
  - 5 tablespoons brewers yeast
  - 3 tablespoons ground flaxseed
  - 0.5 teaspoon baking powder
  - 0.5 teaspoon baking soda
  - 0.5 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  - 0.25 teaspoon salt
  - 12 tablespoons organic unsalted butter
  - 4 tablespoons unrefined organic virgin coconut oil
  - 1.5 cups organic cane sugar
  - 1 large egg + 1 large egg yolk
  - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
  - 1.5 cups dark chocolate chips/chunks, I like ghirardelli
  - "Feel free to add:"
  - 1 unsweetened flaked coconut
  - 1 chopped almonds, 1 to 2 tablespoons of almond butter
directions:
  - ""
  - Preheat the oven the 350 degrees F.
  - In a large bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, yeast, flaxseed, baking
    powder, soda, cinnamon and salt.
  - In the bowl of your electric mixer, beat the butter and coconut oil on
    medium speed until creamy. Add in the sugar and beat on medium to high speed
    until fluffy, about 4 to 5 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl if
    needed. Add in the egg and egg yolk, beating until combined, about 2 to 3
    minutes. Add in the vanilla extract and beat until combined again. Gradually
    add in the dry ingredients, beating on low speed until just combined and
    mixed. Stir in the chocolate chips with a spatula until they are evenly
    dispersed.
  - Scoop the dough into 1-inch rounds (I use an ice cream scoop so they are
    fairly uniform in size) and place on a baking sheet about 2 inches apart.
    Bake for 10 to 14 minutes, or until the bottoms are just golden. Let cool
    completely before storing in a sealed container.
