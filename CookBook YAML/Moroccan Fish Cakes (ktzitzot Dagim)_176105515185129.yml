name: Moroccan Fish Cakes (ktzitzot Dagim)
description: One of my favorites is her Moroccan fish patties, which I was lucky
  to taste at a Shabbat dinner one Friday night with her, Uri, and their four
  year old daughter, Hallel First, she makes a sauce with long, dried shoshka
  peppers, a variety not readily available in the United States; I sub in sweet
  paprika. I always thought the sauce had a lot of tomatoes, so I was surprised
  to see she added only a few thin slices along with bell peppers that get silky
  right in the pan. Keep the temperature relatively low throughout cooking; this
  prevents the patties from breaking apart and allows the sauce to come together
  without too much darkening or burning. Make sure to have challah on hand for
  dipping!

notes: >-
  *To make lemon segments, slice the top and bottom off of the long ends of a
  lemon so it can sit flat on 

  the counter. Using a sharp knife and starting from the top, cut away the zest
  and white pith beneath, 

  leaving the lemon flesh exposed, until you have a lemon-shaped orb of pure
  lemon. Hold the lemon 

  in your hand over a bowl. Release the segments by cutting the flesh away from
  the white membrane 

  surrounding the segments.

ingredients: []
directions:
  - ""
  - ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil 1 small (4 ounce) red onion, finely diced 1
    pound skinless, boneless whitefish fillets, such as cod or snapper, cut into
    large chunks 4 cups packed cilantro leaves and tender stems, chopped (1 cup)
    1 large egg yolk 2½ teaspoons kosher salt ¼ teaspoon crushed whole coriander
    seeds 2 medium (4 pound) red bell peppers, seeded and thinly sliced 5 whole
    garlic cloves and 5 sliced garlic cloves 1 small tomato, cored and sliced
    into very thin rounds 2 medium jalapeños, slit down the center but kept in
    one piece 5 lemon segments (from small lemon)* 2 teaspoons sweet paprika
  - "To make the fish cakes:"
  - Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a 10- or 12-inch skillet over medium
    heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, 6
    to 7 minutes. Transfer to a large mixing bowl. Pulse the fish in the bowl of
    a food processor until very small, distinct pieces remain but the fish isn't
    totally ground, 15 pulses. Gently fold the chopped fish into the cooled
    onions and add 1/4 cup chopped cilantro with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil,
    the egg yolk, 1½ teaspoons of salt, and the coriander seeds. Gently form the
    mixture into 12 equal patties (about 3 tablespoons per patty), place them on
    a plate in a single layer, cover with plastic wrap, and chill while you make
    the sauce.
  - "To make the sauce:"
  - While the fish cakes chill, in the same skillet you used to sauté the
    onions, heat an additional 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-low
    heat, add the bell peppers with the whole and sliced garlic cloves and cook,
    stirring, until very soft, 10 minutes. Add the tomato slices, jalapeños, ½
    cup chopped cilantro, lemon segments,
  - paprika, the remaining 14 teaspoons salt, and the remaining 2 tablespoons of
    olive oil and cook, stirring, until the tomatoes begin to soften, 3 to 4
    minutes. Add 1 cup water, bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce the
    heat to medium-low, and simmer until the mixture thickens, 9 to 10 minutes.
    Gently arrange the fish cakes in the skillet and cook, spooning the sauce
    over the cakes, until the underside is just cooked, 4 minutes. Gently flip
    the fish cakes, add 1/4 cup cilantro, and cook until the patties are just
    cooked through, spooning more sauce on top as you cook, another 4 minutes.
    Garnish with the remaining ¼ cup cilantro before serving.
