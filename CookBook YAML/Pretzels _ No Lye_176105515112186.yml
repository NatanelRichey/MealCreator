  1750 kcal per batch
  150 kcal each (12 pretzels)
ingredients:
  - 1 cup water, 250mL
  - 1 bread flour, 430g white spelt, but it really depends so just go by feel
  - 1 tablespoon melted butter, or oil
  - 1 teaspoon dry yeast
  - 1 tablespoon sugar
  - 1 teaspoon salt, for the dough
  - 1 coarse salt for topping
  - 1 baking soda to make washing soda, I use whole box and save the rest for
    next time

    To convert baking soda (sodium hydrogencarbonate) to washing soda (sodium
    carbonate), pour the baking soda in a pot and turn the heat on high. Stir
    the pan frequently to make sure all the powder heats evenly. Eventually
    you'll start to see little plumes of gas escaping, especially when you stir
    the powder. (It'll look most dramatic if you give the pan a vigorous shake).
    This is water and carbon dioxide leaving the pan. Keep cooking until you no
    longer see any signs of gas when you agitate the powder — it takes me about
    15 minutes. If everything went well, the powder should weight a little less
    than 2/3rds of what it weighed originally. Let cool and keep dry in a sealed
    nonreactive container — plastic is good. It's mildly caustic, so try not to
    let it sit on your skin for too long, try not to get it in your eyes or
    breath a lot of it in, etc.


    To make the dough, combine the water, sugar, butter, yeast, salt and as much
    flour as you can stir in with a spoon. Cover and let sit for 20 minutes
    (this would be a good time to make your washing soda). After it's sat, it
    will be much easier to knead in some more four — enough to get a smooth
    dough ball that's just barely sticky. Cover and let rise until about
    doubled, 1-2 hours.


    Take the risen dough ball out and cut it into quarters. Roll each quarter up
    into a little log (see video), cover, and let sit for at least 30 min before
    shaping. To shape, lightly flour your counter, grab a dough log and use flat
    hands to roll the outer arms of the dough thin while leaving fat belly of
    the dough intact (again, see video). Roll the rope of dough longer than you
    think you want it. Grab the ends and make a U shape, twist the ends and then
    flop them over the belly of the dough (again, see vid). Once shaped, cover
    and let proof for about 30 min until puffy, or don't. Some Germans prefer to
    cook them right away for a denser texture.


    It's much easier to boil the pretzel dough if it's cold — almost frozen
    solid. I recommend putting the fully-proofed doughs in the freezer for 20-30
    min while you pre-heat the oven (425ºF/220ºC, or a little hotter if you like
    darker, crispier pretzels) and bring your washing soda bath to a boil.


    Get a wide, deep pan of water for the washing soda bath, and a wide, deep
    bowl of plain water for rinsing the pretzels after the bath. Turn heat on
    high and dissolve about as much of your washing soda into the water in the
    pan as possible, but be conservative — it's better to have a solution that's
    not fully saturated vs a solution with big washing soda particles floating
    around in it (they could stick to the pretzel and taste bitter). 


    The water should be clear after a couple minutes of heating and stirring.
    Anything between a bare simmer and a full boil is fine. (This solution is
    mildly caustic, but not super dangerous. If you get it on your hands, wash
    it off, but you're unlikely to get a chemical burn unless you bathe in it.)


    When the pretzels are firm, drop them in the hot water and cook for about 15
    seconds — I recommend doing this one at a time. Transfer to the bowl of
    plain water and rinse clean (the solution tastes bitter). Transfer to a
    baking sheet and top with coarse salt while it's still wet (the water will
    hold the salt in place). Repeat with the other pretzels, and if you want you
    can score the fat belly of each with a knife to let it puff up more in the
    oven.


    Bake until very brown, about 15 minutes. To make the pretzels shinier, you
    can spray them or paint them with water once or twice during the bake.
    Easier, though less effective, is to do the same right after they finish
    baking but are still hot.
