name: Mango Curry
servings: 6 servings
notes: Mangoes that are slightly unripe, on the firm side, will hold up better
  in this recipe, but won't be as sweet as ripe mangoes. So, if you use firm,
  less than perfectly ripe mangoes, you may need to balance the recipe with more
  sugar or raisins. If you use sweet mangoes, you may need to balance the recipe
  with a little more vinegar.

    here’s how


    Cook onions, bell pepper, garlic, ginger, spices: Heat oil in a large sauté
    pan over medium heat. Add onions and bell pepper cook, stirring
    occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and
    cook for another minute.

    Add the curry powder and cumin, cook for a few more minutes. The spices will
    absorb some of the oil, so if anything begins to stick too much to the
    bottom of the pan, add a little more oil to the pan.
  - Add the vinegar, coconut milk, and chopped mangoes to the pan. Increase the
    heat and bring to a boil, then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer for
    about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  - "Purée sauce: Remove pan from heat. Scoop the sauce into a blender. Purée
    the sauce, pulsing until smooth. Return the sauce to the pan."
  - Add chicken pieces and raisins to the pan. Return to a low simmer. Cover the
    pan and let cook for 8-10 minutes. Chicken should be just cooked through.
    Use a knife to cut open the largest piece to check.
  - Stir in the cream, if using. Let cook at a very low temperature for another
    minute or two, uncovered. Do not let boil! Or the cream may curdle.
  - "Adjust seasonings: If a little too sweet, add a little more vinegar. If not
    sweet enough, you can add a dash of sugar. Add salt and pepper to taste."
  - Serve over rice. Garnish with coriander.
