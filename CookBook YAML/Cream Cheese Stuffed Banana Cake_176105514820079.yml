  - Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and spray all inside surfaces of a 16 cup
    nonstick angel food cake pan with nonstick cooking spray WITH FLOUR or
    grease and flour the inside of your pan.
  - "Streusel:"
  - Add walnuts to your food processor and pulse 3 times. Add flour, brown sugar
    and cinnamon and pulse a few times to combine. Sprinkle cold butter over top
    and pulse until the walnuts are chopped and the mixture resembles small
    pebbles. (You may also combine in a bowl and cut butter in by hand). Set
    aside in the refrigerator.
  - "Cake:"
  - >-
    In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt,
    and cinnamon. Set aside.

    Using a stand or hand mixer, beat butter and sugar until fluffy on medium
    high speed, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating just until the
    yellow disappears after each egg. Mix in vanilla and bananas until just
    until combined.

    Gradually add flour mixture to banana/butter mixture in thirds, alternately
    with sour cream in between each third. Beat until just combined. Measure out
    1/4 cup batter and set aside for cream cheese filling. Stir chocolate chips
    and walnuts into remaining batter until just until combined.

    Measure out 1 cup batter (to top cream cheese layer) and spoon the rest of
    the batter into the prepared pan.
  - To your now empty mixing bowl, add 1/4 cup reserved batter, cream cheese, 1
    teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 cup sugar. Beat on medium high speed until smooth
    and creamy, about 1 minute.

    Spoon Cream Cheese Filling over batter and gently smooth, but do not touch
    the sides of the pan. Spread reserved 1 cup batter evenly over filling (it
    will be very thin).

    Tap pan on counter a few times to get rid of any air bubbles then sprinkle
    evenly with Cinnamon Walnut Streusel.
  - Bake for 55-60 minutes at 350 degrees F or until toothpick inserted comes
    out clean (without inserting in cream cheese). Some readers have stated
    their cake was not done in 60 minutes, so if it's not done, bake on! Let
    baked cake cool on wire rack for 1 hour. Gently invert cake onto a baking
    sheet, remove pan, and invert back onto cooling rack streusel side up. Let
    cool to room temperature.
  - >-
    When ready to serve, whisk Vanilla Glaze ingredients together in a medium
    bowl and drizzle over cake. Sprinkle cake with mini chocolate chips
    (optional)

    Store in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.
