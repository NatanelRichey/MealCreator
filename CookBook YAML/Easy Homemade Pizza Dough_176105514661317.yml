ingredients:
  - 1 cup warm water, 105-110 degrees F
  - 1 tbls sugar
  - 1 tbls active dry yeast
  - 1 tbls olive oil
  - 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour*, 2-2 .5
  - 1 tsp salt
directions:
  - ""
  - Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Grease a pizza pan or large jelly roll pan
    and set aside.
  - Put warm water into a large mixing bowl.
  - Add sugar and yeast and stir to combine.
  - Let mixture sit for 5 minutes, or until it becomes frothy and bubbles form.
  - Add olive oil and gently stir to combine.
  - Add 2 cups of flour and salt and mix with a spatula until a ball begins to
    form (dough will still be slightly sticky). Add more flour as needed to form
    a dough ball.
  - Transfer to a floured surface and knead into a smooth dough, adding up to ½
    cup extra flour if needed.
  - Roll dough into your desired shape and gently transfer to your prepared pan.
  - To ensure the dough doesn't form air pockets, use a fork to prick to the
    dough all around (gently so you do not poke holes all the way through the
    crust).
  - Bake on the lower rack of your preheated oven for 5 minutes and remove from
    your oven. (this is just to very slightly prebake the dough). If you notice
    air bubbles forming, poke them with a fork to let the air out.
  - Add pizza sauce and toppings of choice!
  - Bake on the lower rack of your oven for around 15-20 minutes until the crust
    looks crispy and lightly browned.
  - Let cool, cut and serve!
