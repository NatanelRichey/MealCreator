ingredients:
  - "Soak:"
  - 1 kg packet of raw chickpeas
  - 4 tsp baking soda
  - "Blend:"
  - 2.5 cups chickpea soup
  - 1 clove garlic
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1 cup raw tahini
  - 1 cup water
  - 0.25 cup lemon juice, freshly squeezed
directions:
  - "Soak Chickpeas:"
  - Rinse chickpeas in strainer.
  - Soak in large bowl for 18-24hrs until chickpeas have doubled in size. (You
    can leave one chickpea out to compare).
  - Cover the chickpeas with 4 fingers of water on top of them (chickpeas will
    absorb their weight in water).
  - Mix in the baking soda.
  - Occassionally stir the chickpeas, adding water if necessary. It's normal to
    see white bubbles on the surface of the water
  - "Cook Chickpeas:"
  - Strain our the water and give the chickpeas a rinse before placing them in a
    large pot.
  - Add 3 litres of boiled water, bring the water and chickpeas to a rolling
    boil.
  - For the first 30 minutes, it is normal to see foam on the surface, strain
    and discard the foam.
  - Continue to cook the chickpeas for another 1.5 hours, until the water has
    reduced and is cloudy and gelatinous, and the chickpeas are creamy and soft
    (don't be scared to taste one). It may take longer.
  - "Blend Chickpeas:"
  - Place 1.5 cups of the soupy chickpea mixture into the blender, about half
    the pot. Set aside the remaining 1.5 cups in a plastic zip-lock bag and lie
    flat in the freezer for the next time.
  - Add garlic and salt.
  - Blend for 2 minutes until smooth.
  - Blend for another 2 minutes. This time, drizzle in the 1 cup of tahini and
    the 1 cup of water and 1/4 cup of lemon juice, alternating between the
    three.
  - If mixture isn't smooth enough continue to blend.
