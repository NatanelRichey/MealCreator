  Norene's Notes

  • Pareve option: Substitute Coconut "Whipped Cream" for Cream Cheese 

  Frosting. Chill 2 cans (14 oz/398 ml each) organic unsweetened full-fat 

  coconut milk overnight. Open cans from the bottom; pour off coconut liquid 

  (save for smoothies). Whip thickened coconut cream in a chilled bowl until 

  light. Blend in 1/4 cup confectioner's sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. Spread on
  cake.

    eggs with sugar, oil, and vanilla on medium-high speed about 3-5 minutes,
    until light. Add carrots; mix well.

    salt. Stir to combine.
  - Reduce mixer speed to low. Add flour mixture; mix just until combined.

    inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool completely.
