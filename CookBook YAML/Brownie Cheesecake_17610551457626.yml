name: Brownie Cheesecake
description: >-
  Brownies and cheesecake are two of my favourite sweet treats and putting them
  together

  in this recipe makes one of my favourite cheesecakes. The cheesecake is
  perfect to serve

  for afternoon tea or morning coffee but also makes an indulgent dessert served
  with scoops

  of vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce. As with all brownie recipes,
  feel free to add

  additional ingredients - omit the nuts if you wish, and add chocolate chips
  and orange zest

  for the perfect chocolate orange treat.

ingredients:
  - "For the brownies:"
  - 100 g butter
  - 150 g dark chocolate
  - 100 g caster/white sugar
  - 100 g soft dark brown sugar
  - 2 eggs
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 80 g cup plain/all-purpose flour, sifted
  - 50 g chopped pecans
  - "For the topping:"
  - 150 g cream cheese
  - 160 ml sour cream
  - 50 g caster/white sugar
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
  - 2 eggs
  - 30 g plain/all-purpose flour, sifted
  - 125 g dark chocolate, chopped
  - 1 23 cm/9 inch round springform cake pan, greased and lined
directions:
  - ""
  - Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) Gas
  - To prepare the brownies, melt the butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl
    set over a small pan of simmering water, taking care that the bottom of the
    bowl does not touch the water. Stir until melted, then leave to cool.
  - In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugars and eggs with the vanilla
    until doubled in size and the mixture is very light and creamy. Slowly pour
    in the cooled melted chocolate mixture, whisking all the time. Fold in the
    flour and nuts, then pour into the prepared cake pan.
  - For the cheesecake topping, whisk together the cream cheese, sour cream,
    sugar, vanilla, eggs and flour until smooth, then stir through the chopped
    chocolate. Place large spoonfuls of the cheesecake mixture at intervals on
    top of the brownie mixture. Swirl the cheesecake and brownie mixtures
    together with a round-bladed knife to create swirled patterns.
  - Bake the cheesecake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes until a crust
    has formed on the brownie and the cheesecake mixture is set. Allow to cool
    before serving.
