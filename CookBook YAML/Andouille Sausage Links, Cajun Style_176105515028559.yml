ingredients:
  - 5 pounds beef, 70 30
  - 33 grams kosher salt, about 3 tablespoons
  - 4 grams Instacure No. 1, about a teaspoon
  - 3 tablespoons minced fresh garlic
  - 2 teaspoons cayenne
  - 2 tablespoons sweet paprika
  - 2 teaspoons dried thyme
  - 0.5 cup ice water or beer, put in fridge to keep it cold
  - 1 Hog casings
directions:
  - ""
  - Take about 10 to 15 feet of casings (typically three lengths) and submerge
    them in warm water.
  - Cut the meat and fat into chunks and toss with the salt, Instacure, garlic,
    cayenne, paprika and thyme. You need the Instacure No. 1 as a safety measure
    when you smoke the links; if you don't plan on smoking them, you need not
    use this. Put everything in a container and freeze for 30 minutes to 1 hour,
    or until the mixture is 35°F or colder. You can also put the mix in the
    fridge overnight; this will help the bind.
  - Grind everything through the coarse die, 7 or 8 mm. Andouille is most
    typically a country-style, coarse sausage. If you want, you can even
    hand-mince the meat yourself. If you want to do this, hand mince 1/4 of the
    meat and fat mixture to get a more interesting texture for your sausage.
  - Make sure the mixture is very cold, about 30°F; you will probably need to
    freeze it again for a while. When it's cold enough, take it out and add the
    chilled water or beer to the bowl and mix on the lowest setting for 90
    seconds to 2 minutes, or with your very clean hands for 2 minutes. The look
    of the meat will change as it binds to itself, and will look more like thick
    batter than ground meat and fat.
  - "If you are making patties, you're done. Store each patty between pieces of
    wax paper and then wrap tightly in plastic wrap, then foil, before freezing.
    If you are making links, load up a sausage stuffer with the meat and fat.
    Rinse the casings by running warm water through them: You want to flush some
    salt and check for any holes in the casings. Thread an entire casing onto
    the stuffer and fill it slowly. Coil the filled casing as you go. Fill all
    the casings before making individual links."
  - To make individual links, tie off one end of a casing. Compress the sausage
    inside it to fill that end link. Pinch off a link and flip it away from you
    several times to tighten it. Move down the coil and pinch down another link.
    This time, flip the link back toward you to tighten it. Repeat this process
    down the coil until you get to the end. Tie off the end link. Repeat with
    all the other casings.
  - Hang your sausages to dry for an hour or more. Hang for 1 to 2 hours at room
    temperature, or up to overnight where your temperatures are below 45°F. I
    use a standard clothes drying rack to hang my links. When the sausages are
    hanging, use a large needle to pierce any spots on the links where there is
    air trapped underneath. Sterilize the needle in the flames of a gas burner
    or with a lighter until it glows. You need to pierce any trapped air or your
    links could burst when you cook them.
  - Once the sausages have hung, smoke them over pecan wood for 3 to 4 hours. If
    you hot-smoke your links, pull them when they reach an internal temperature
    of 155°F. If your links don't get to that temperature in time, you can
    either smoke them longer, or you can finish the cooking in an oven set at
    200°F. Once they're fully cooked, let them cool before freezing.
