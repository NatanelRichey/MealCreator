ingredients:
  - 2 cups flour
  - 1 cup dutch process cocoa powder
  - 2 tsp baking powder
  - ½ tsp salt
  - ⅔ cup Colavita 100% Greek olive oil

    In a bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt. 

    In a separate bowl, combine the olive oil, sugar, eggs, vanilla, and
    coffee. 

    Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir well to combine. 

    If any lumps remain, stir the mixture with a hand-mixer until all the
    ingredients are well incorporated.
  - Place the dough in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight.
  - Roll 1 heaping tablespoon of batter into a ball and place on a
    parchment-lined baking sheet. Make sure to roll the batter quickly
    (otherwise the heat of your hands will make it sticky). Repeat with
    remaining batter.
  - Spray the cookies with gold spray paint and bake at 350 degrees for
    approximately 12 minutes. Set aside to cool.
  - While the cookies are still a little warm (but not too hot that they will
    melt the chocolate), press chocolate coins into the center of each cookie.
  - "VARIATION: Spray the cookies with silver color mist and top with milk
    chocolate coins. If you prefer not to use color mist, you can roll the
    cookies in turbinado or powdered sugar instead."
  - "NOTE: If you do not have Colavita 100% Greek olive oil, you may substitute
    with any other olive oil."
