  I've loved mafroum ever since I first had it at Guetta, a Libyan joint at the
  edge of Jaffa not 

  far from where we live. Libyan-inspired food, nicknamed Tripolitani cuisine
  after the country's 

  capital, feels a little less spicy than some other North African cuisines,
  with thicker tomato 

  sauces-perhaps because Libya was once an Italian colony. Mafroum is sometimes
  made with 

  potatoes, or even cauliflower, but there's no beating the way the eggplant,
  slit open to create 

  receptacles for the highly seasoned filling, absorbs the delicious
  tomato-based sauce. Many reci- 

  pes call for just cinnamon in the meat, but I like the way baharat, with its
  notes of allspice, warms 

  up the filling.

directions:
  - "Make the filling:"
  - Arrange a clean kitchen towel on a work surface and pile the onion, sweet
    potato, and soaked bread in the middle of it. Close up the towel and,
    working over the sink, twist the towel from the sides until you have
    squeezed out as much liquid as you can from the contents. Open the towel,
    dump the contents into a large bowl, use your fingers to break up any large
    bits of bread, and add the beef, parsley, chives, baharat, beaten eggs,
    garlic, salt, and pepper and mix gently with your hands until everything is
    incorporated.
  - "Prepare the eggplant:"
  - Whisk the eggs and salt in a small bowl. Combine the flour and paprika in a
    second bowl. Place each eggplant on a cutting board, trim off and discard
    the ends, and cut twelve 3/4-inch rounds from the 2 eggplants, trying to
    make all the rounds as
  - equal in diameter as possible. Reserve the leftover eggplant for the Sabich
    Fattoush Salad (page 182) or P'titm (page 196). To make the mafroum pockets,
    lay each eggplant round flat on the cutting board and slice through the
    middle, moving the knife through the center slice but stopping short of
    cutting through it by about ½ inch so the ends on one side are still
    attached (it should look like an almost split pita). Stuff each sliced
    eggplant with meat filling; using between 4 and 1/3 cup filling per eggplant
    silce, depending on the diameter of the eggplant. Press the top to "seal" it
    all together you'll have filling that is exposed, but don't worry it won't
    fall out.
  - "Fry the eggplant:"
  - Heat ½ inch vegetable oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. While
    the oil is heating, coat each filled eggplant pocket completely in the flour
    and then the egg, shaking off the excess between dips. Working in 2 batches,
    fry the eggplant until each side is golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
    Transfer the eggplant to a tray and drain and discard all but 3 tablespoons
    of the oil in the pan (or replace with new oil if yours seems burned).
  - "Make the sauce:"
  - Add the onions to the pan and cook over medium heat, stirring, until
    softened and golden, 8 to 9 minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 more minute.
    Add the tomato paste, paprika, baharat, salt, and cayenne and cook,
    stirring, until fragrant and the tomato paste is slightly caramelized, 2
    minutes. Add the broth and tomatoes and bring to a boil, then gently nestle
    the fried stuffed eggplants in the sauce. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover
    with a tight-fitting lid, and cook until the eggplant is tender and has
    absorbed some of the sauce, 40 minutes. Uncover and cook for 5 more minutes.
    Serve with couscous.
