notes: >-
  You can use ready jarred roasted red peppers for this recipe, instead of
  roasting them yourself

  Be sure to lightly toast the walnuts and breadcrumbs for optimal flavour

  If you don't have Aleppo pepper, replace with half the amount of chilli flakes

  Do not use more lemon juice than specified, because it may overpower the
  flavours

  Traditional muhammara does not use sundried tomatoes, but I love adding them
  for a deeper flavour. Feel free to substitute Â½ tablespoon of tomato paste
  instead.

ingredients:
  - 3 large red peppers
  - 0.5 cup breadcrumbs
  - 0.5 cup walnuts, raw, unsalted
  - 2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses
  - 0.25 cup extra virgin olive oil
  - 1 large garlic clove
  - 1 teaspoon aleppo pepper, or substitute with half the amount in chilli flakes
  - 0.5 teaspoon salt
  - 4 sun dried tomatoes, optional - see notes
  - 1 tablespoon tomato paste
  - 1 tablespoon lemon juice
directions:
  - ""
  - Start by pre-heating the oven to 450F
  - Wash and cut the red peppers in half. Remove all the seeds
  - To char the red peppers before roasting, place the peppers skin side down in
    a cast-iron pan over medium high heat and char for 5-6 minutes
  - Cover with foil and place in the oven. Bake for 30 - 45 minutes, until the
    peppers are soft
  - Take them out of the oven and cover the pan with foil paper right away
  - Allow the peppers to rest for 10 minutes. This allows them to soften and
    makes removing the peel much easier
  - Peel the peppers carefully with tongs or using your hands, and discard the
    peels
  - Lightly toast the bread crumbs in an oil free pan over medium heat and set
    aside
  - Lightly toast the walnuts in an oil free pan over medium heat, and set aside
  - Add the roasted peppers along with the bread crumbs, walnuts, and all other
    ingredients to a food processor
  - Process until a paste forms, stopping to scrape the sides of the food
    processor as necessary. The final dip should have a bit of texture
  - Spread onto a dish and garnish with pomegranate molasses, walnuts and
    parsley. Serve with pita bread
