ingredients:
  - 230 grams (1 cup / 2 sticks) unsalted butter, chopped
  - 300 grams (2 cups) white chocolate
  - 200 grams (1 cup) caster sugar
  - 240 ml (1 cup) milk
  - 2 large eggs
  - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
  - 350 grams (2 and.5 cups) plain flour
  - 2 teaspoons baking powder
  - 230 grams (1 cup / 2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
  - 150 grams (1 cup) white chocolate, pieces
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 435 grams (3 and.5 cups) powdered or icing sugar
  - 115 grams (.5 cup or 1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
  - 100 grams (.66 cups) dark chocolate, broken into pieces
  - 250 grams (2 cups) icing or powdered sugar
  - 2 tablespoons milk
  - 1 Cadbury Topdeck Chocolates, for decorating
directions:
  - ""
  - Preheat oven to 180C (360F). Grease and link two 8-inch round cake tins with
    baking or parchment paper.
  - In a medium saucepan, add butter, white chocolate, sugar and milk. Place on
    medium heat, stirring until smooth and sugar has dissolved. Set aside for a
    few minutes to cool slightly.
  - Add eggs and vanilla to cooled white chocolate mixture and stir until
    combined. Add flour and baking powder and stir until combined – don’t worry
    if the batter is a little lumpy.
  - Divide the cake batter between the two cake tins and place in the oven for
    approximately 30-35 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the middle comes
    out clean. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
  - To make the white chocolate frosting, place butter in a large mixing bowl
    and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until pale and creamy.
    Meanwhile melt the chocolate in a microwave, stirring in between 20 second
    bursts, until just melted and set aside.
  - Add vanilla, half the sugar and one tablespoon of milk to the butter and
    beat until combined. Add the remaining sugar and beat until smooth.
  - Add melted chocolate, ensuring the chocolate is still smooth and melted but
    is not warm. Beat until the chocolate is completely mixed through. If
    frosting is too thick, add an extra tablespoon of milk.
  - Place one cake layer onto a cake board or stand. Cover the top with white
    chocolate buttercream. Place second cake layer on top (upside down for a
    nice flat top). Frost the top and sides of cake. Smooth sides using a cake
    scraper.
  - To make the chocolate frosting, place butter in a large mixing bowl and beat
    with an electric mixer on medium speed until pale and creamy. Meanwhile melt
    the chocolate in a microwave, stirring in between 20 second bursts, until
    just melted and set aside.
  - Add half the sugar and one tablespoon of milk to the butter and beat until
    combined. Add the remaining sugar and beat until smooth. Add extra
    tablespoon of milk if needed.
  - Add chocolate frosting to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip and
    pipe frosting around the edge of the cake. Decorate with chocolate pieces.
