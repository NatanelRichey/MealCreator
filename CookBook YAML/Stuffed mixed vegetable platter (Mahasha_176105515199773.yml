name: Stuffed mixed vegetable platter (Mahasha)
description: This recipe was given to me by my Aunt Doreen who makes a most
  delicious mahasha. Traditionally, the dolma is made with fresh vine leaves; if
  you can't get hold of some, the alternative is to buy them vacuume-packed in
  jars from Middle Eastern shops. For this recipe, I would recommend preparing
  all the ingredients in 3 lots, before starting to cook.

ingredients:
  - 1 Serves 4 to 5
  - 1 Vegetables to stuff
  - 1 very small red pepper or
  - 2 small tomatoes
  - 2 courgettes
  - 3 onions, 2-3
  - 12 or more vine leaves
  - 1 The stuffing
  - 250 g rice
  - 250 g minced lamb
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 2 tablespoons tomato paste
  - 1 large fresh tomato,
  - 1 chopped and peeled
  - 6 heaped tablespoons finely
  - 1 chopped flat parsley
  - 5 tablespoons finely
  - 1 chopped mint
  - 1 The segments of 2 large
  - 1 lemons
  - 1.75 teaspoon salt
  - 1 pinch of pepper
  - 1 The stewing liquid
  - 4 tablespoons lemon juice
  - 4 tablespoons sugar
  - 3 tablespoons tomato paste
  - 2 garlic cloves, peeled and
  - 1 chopped
  - 1 teaspoon salt
directions:
  - ""
  - Wash the rice and soak for 30 minutes or so.
  - The stewing liquid
  - Combine all the stewing liquid ingredients, making sure the sugar dissolves,
    and set aside.
  - The vegetables
  - Peel the onions. Slit one side of each onion from top to bottom. Cut only
    half way through. Boil them for 10 to 15 minutes until the layers can be
    detached and separated. Drain and leave to cool.
  - Meanwhile, wash the pepper (or tomatoes), slice off its top and reserve as
    it will be used as a cover. (You do the same for the tomatoes.) Remove the
    core and seeds.
  - Wash the courgettes. Peel them and cut in half. Core them three- quarters of
    the way and reserve the inside. This will be added to the stuffing.
  - Now, wash the vine leaves and soak them in boiling water for two to three
    minutes. Unravel the cooled onion skins. These will be filled with the
    stuffing.
  - The Stuffing
  - With a sharp knife cut away the peel and the pith of the 2 lemons. Carefully
    cut out all the segments and slice them in small pieces.
  - Drain the rice and tip it into a bowl. Add the minced meat, a little at a
    time and knead well. Add the cored bits of courgettes and the rest of the
    stuffing ingredients and mix well.
  - Prepare a deep frying pan or saucepan, large enough to hold all the stuffed
    vegetables in a single layer, and coat the bottom with 2 tablespoons of oil.
  - Stuff each onion skin with a tablespoon of stuffing, close and arrange
    tightly in the pan. Stuff the courgettes and arrange next to the onions.
    Stuff the pepper, cover it with its sliced top and put it in the middle of
    the pan.
  - Now, take a vine leaf. Place a tablespoon of stuffing in the middle, fold
    and roll once, tuck in the edges and roll till the end. Arrange each stuffed
    vine leaf tightly one next to the other. If there is no room at the bottom
    of the pan put the vine leaves on top of the other vegetables.
  - Cook the vegetables on low heat for about 3 minutes, then, pour the stewing
    liquid over them, covering them three-quarters of the way up. Bring to the
    boil and continue cooking, half-covered, for 5 minutes.
  - Reduce the heat to medium, cover and cook for 30 minutes.
  - "Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook covered for another 50 minutes or
    until almost all the liquid has been absorbed, leaving very little sauce at
    the bottom of the pot. Add more water whilst cooking, if necessary. Be
    careful not to burn the vegetables. Serve on a platter with the pepper or
    tomatoes in the middle. Variation: You can substitute fine soya mince for
    the meat."
