ingredients:
  - 1 large aubergine
  - 1 onion
  - 1.5 tsp paprika
  - 0.5 tsp chilli powder
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1.5 tsp sugar
  - 2 tbsp tomato paste
  - 1 tbsp pomegranate molasses
  - 0.5 cup olive oil
  - 3 garlic cloves
directions:
  - ""
  - Start by washing and peeling your eggplant every other stripe (like a zebra
    pattern) and cut into small cubes.
  - Slice your onions into thin slices.
  - Mix together the paprika, chilli powder, salt, sugar, tomato paste,
    pomegranate molasses, olive oil, and crushed garlic until well combined.
  - Marinate the eggplant and onions with the mixture until well combined.
  - Place in an oven dish with a lid and bake at 400F for 1 hour.
  - Check to ensure eggplant is really soft (may need more time depending on
    oven). You should be able to mash it really easily with a fork.
  - Mash the dip with a fork to create a chunky consistency (or continue mashing
    for a more smooth paste - per preference).
  - Adjust salt to your liking and cool the dip in the fridge.
  - Garnish with more olive oil, parsley, walnuts and serve with pita bread.
    Enjoy!
