    Gril aubergine on the fire or in oven on grill setting 200 C


    Shallow fry the peppers in oil (1/4 cup)

    When I doubled the recipe half a cup of oil was too much 1/3 cup would’ve
    been good 


    When well browed add the cubed tomatoes with salt and sugar. 

    Leave it to fry until it reduces around 20-30mins. 


    Take out pepper mixture with a strainer and drain on paper towel. 


    Mix together aubergine lemon juice, fresh garlic and coriander. 


    Add in fried peppers mixture.
