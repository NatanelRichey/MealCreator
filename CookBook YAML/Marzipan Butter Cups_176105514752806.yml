ingredients:
  - 0.75 cups blanched almond meal or
  - 1 flour, see note
  - 0.5 cup + 2 tbsp powdered sugar
  - pinch of sea salt
  - 1 tbsp water
  - 1 tsp pure almond or vanilla extract
  - 10 oz California Gourmet KFP chocolate chips
directions:
  - ""
  - Place the almond meal, powdered sugar and salt in the bowl of a food
    processor with the S blade attached, pulse until the ingredients are
    incorporated. Add the water and almond extract and blend until a paste forms
    and starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl. If the paste is very
    sticky, add more powered sugar until it's easy to handle.
  - Form the paste into a log and wrap tightly in parchment paper to form a log,
    twisting the paper like a candy wrapper. Place the marzipan in the freezer
    to set.
  - In the meantime, place the chocolate chips in a Ziploc freezer bag and add
    to a large bowl. Pour boiling hot water over the bag and leave it in the
    water until the chocolate starts to melt, about 2 minutes.
  - Remove the bag from the water and mix the chocolate in the bag to move
    around the chips that arent melted, return to the water until all the
    chocolate has melted completely
  - Set 10 paper cupcake liners on a baking sheet. Snip the corner of the bag
    and pipe chocolate into each liner to cover the base. Bang the tray down on
    your counter to flatten the layer of chocolate.
  - Remove the marzipan from the freezer and slice into 10 rounds. They should
    be the width of the cupcake liner - if they are smaller just flatten with
    your hand. Place the marzipan on top of the chocolate layer, and cover it
    with more chocolate, banging the sheet tray on the counter to evenly coat
    the marzipan.
  - Sprinkle with more sea salt, if desired,and freeze until solid.
  - Store in an airtight container in the fridge.
  - If you don't like almond extract, you may use vanilla extract although the
    flavor will be different!
  - "VARIATIONS: you can make marzipan out of any nut and use the corresponding
    extract to enhance the flavor. Alternatively, you can use nut butter and add
    powdered sugar to make it more of a dough, then fill as above."
