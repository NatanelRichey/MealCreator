  - 1 egg
  - 1 ½ tsp kosher sea salt
  - 1 280-350 g all-purpose flour, 2.5 cups
  - "For the filling:"
  - 250 g Yellow/Mozzarella cheese
  - 1 egg
  - 1 tsp salt

directions:
  - "Make the dough:"
  - Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C/ Gas Mark 4).
  - In a large bowl, whisk together the oil, water, egg, and salt until well
    combined and foamy.
  - Stir in the flour, a little at a time, until a soft dough forms (you might
    not use the full 350 g).
  - Form the dough into a disc, wrap with plastic wrap (cling film), and let sit
    at room temperature while making the filling.
  - "Make the filling:"
  - Combine the filling ingredients
  - "Cheese filling option 2:"
  - In a food processor, combine the feta, parmesan, eggs, onion powder (if
    using), salt, and pepper, and pulse until a thick paste forms.
  - "Assemble the turnovers:"
  - Pinch off a walnut-size piece of dough and roll it into a ball. Working on a
    lightly floured surface, roll it out into a 4-inch (10 cm) round. Place a
    heaping tablespoon of the filling into the middle of the round. Fold one
    side of the round over to the other to make a half-moon, pinching it tightly
    to seal the filling inside. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
  - "Bake the sambusak:"
  - >-
    Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper and dived the turnovers
    between them. Brush the tops of the turnovers with a little egg wash (you
    might not use all of it) and sprinkle with sesame seeds (if using). 

    Bake until golden brown, 25- 35 minutes.

    Set the baking sheets on wire racks to cool.
