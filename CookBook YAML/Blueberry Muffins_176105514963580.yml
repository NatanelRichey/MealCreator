name: Blueberry Muffins
description: These blueberry muffins are buttery, soft, and moist. For that
  bakery-style goodness, add an easy cinnamon brown sugar topping. This thick
  muffin batter combined with my initial high oven temperature trick guarantees
  tall muffin tops. Prepared with basic ingredients and a couple mixing bowls,
  you'll appreciate this easy breakfast recipe.

ingredients:
  - 100 g packed light or dark brown sugar, 0.5 cup
  - 67 g chopped walnuts or pecans
  - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  - 219 g all-purpose flour
  - 1 teaspoon baking soda
  - 1 teaspoon baking powder
  - 0.5 teaspoon salt
  - 113 g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
  - 100 g cup granulated sugar, 0.5 cup
  - 50 g cup packed light or dark brown sugar, 0.25 cup
  - 2 large eggs, at room temperature
  - 0.5 cup sour cream or plain/vanilla yogurt, at room temperature, 120g
  - 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
  - 0.25 cup milk, at room temperature, 60ml
  - 210 g fresh or frozen blueberries
directions:
  - ""
  - Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Spray a 12-count muffin pan with nonstick
    spray or use cupcake liners. Grease/line a second pan with 2 liners because
    this recipe yields about 14 muffins. Set aside.
  - Mix all of the topping ingredients together. Set aside.
  - Whisk the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a large
    bowl. Set aside.
  - Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment,
    beat the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together on high speed
    until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. On medium speed, add the eggs one
    at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the sour cream and
    vanilla extract on medium speed until combined. With the mixer running on
    low speed, add the dry ingredients and milk into the wet ingredients and
    beat until no flour pockets remain. Fold in the blueberries.
  - Spoon the batter into liners, filling them all the way to the top. Spoon
    brown sugar topping on each, gently pressing it down into the surface so it
    sticks. Bake for 5 minutes at 425 then, keeping the muffins in the oven,
    reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (177°C). Bake for an additional 18–20
    minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The
    total time these muffins take in the oven is about 23–25 minutes, give or
    take. Allow the muffins to cool for 5 minutes in the muffin pan, then
    transfer to a wire rack to continue cooling.
  - Muffins stay fresh covered at room temperature for a few days or in the
    refrigerator for up to 1 week.
