    DIRECTIONS


    In a very large pot, heat oil on medium high. Add the onions and cook until
    translucent. Add the meats, a pinch of salt, and sear on both sides. Add the
    potatoes, barley, and prunes. Pour enough boiling water to cover mixture.
    Season with paprika, cinnamon, salt, pepper and bring to a boil.

  - Place the eggs over the mixture, reduce heat to simmer, cover and cook for
    another 15-20 minutes. Transfer to a hot plate for 18-24 hours, or until
    ready to eat on Shabbat.
