notes: >-
  If you don't have buttermilk, you can make your own by combining 1/2 cup of
  milk with 1.5 tsp lemon juice or white vinegar. Let the mixture sit for a few
  minutes until it starts to curdle.

  The longer you beat the sugar and butter, the better the result will be
  because this process incorporates air into the batter and makes the cake
  fluffy and tender

  I recommend using fresh lemon juice but you can also use bottled lemon juice

  This cake would also taste great with lime juice or orange juice

  Some readers have commented that their cake stuck to the pan. If you're unsure
  how well your cake pans perform, line the pan with parchment paper. In my
  experience, this cake always comes out of the pan easily if it is greased
  well. I use these OXO cake pans (affiliate link).

ingredients:
  - "For the lemon pound cake:"
  - 1.5 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1.5 tsp baking powder
  - 1 Tbsp lemon zest
  - 0.5 tsp salt
  - 0.5 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
  - 1 cup granulated sugar
  - 2 large eggs, room temperature
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - 2 Tbsp lemon juice, about 1/2 lemon
  - 0.5 cup buttermilk, see below for substitution
  - "For the lemon syrup:"
  - 0.25 cup lemon juice, about 1 lemon
  - 3 Tbsp powdered sugar
  - "For the lemon icing:"
  - 1 cup powdered sugar, sifted
  - 1.5 Tbsp lemon juice
  - 1 Tbsp milk
directions:
  - ""
  - Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease a 9x5-inch (or 8x4-inch) loaf pan (see
    note).
  - In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder, lemon zest, and salt. Set
    aside.
  - In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or using an
    electric mixer), cream the butter and sugar together at medium-high speed
    until pale and fluffy, about 4-6 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl as
    needed.
  - With the mixer running on low-speed, add the eggs one at a time, then beat
    in the vanilla extract and lemon juice. Beat on medium-high speed until
    combined.
  - With the mixer on low, add about one-third of the flour mixture and mix
    until almost combined, then add half the buttermilk and mix until just
    combined. Repeat with another third of flour mixture and then the last half
    of the buttermilk, ending with the last third of the flour. Beat until just
    incorporated.
  - Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 45-55 minutes
    until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick comes out mostly clean with
    only a couple moist crumbs. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours.
  - Let the cake cool for about 15 minutes in the pan. Stir together the lemon
    juice and confectioners’ sugar for the lemon syrup. Carefully invert the
    loaf pan, and transfer the cake to a cooling rack, then brush the syrup on
    the cake while it’s still warm. Allow cake to cool completely.
  - When the cake is cooled, combine all the icing ingredients, start with 1
    tbsp lemon juice and milk and add the remaining lemon juice as needed. The
    icing should be thick and not runny. Pour icing over cake and let dry before
    serving.
