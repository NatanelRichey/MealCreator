ingredients:
  - 5 pounds beef, 70 30
  - 35 grams kosher salt
  - 10 grams of cracked black pepper, about 1 tablespoon
  - 20 grams of coarsely ground coriander seed, about 3 to 4 tablespoons
  - 1 gram of ground clove, about a teaspoon
  - 3 grams of ground allspice, about 2 teaspoons
  - 2 teaspoons brown sugar
  - 0.25 cup malt vinegar
  - 0.25 cup brandy
  - 1 Hog casings
directions:
  - ""
  - Get out about 10 feet of hog casings and soak them in warm water.
  - Cut the meat and fat into chunks you can fit into your meat grinder. Mix
    together the salt, pepper, coriander, clove and allspice, then mix this with
    the meat and fat until every piece has a little on it. Refrigerate overnight
    if you want, but let it marinate at least an hour or so; this helps develop
    myosin in the mixture, which helps the texture of the finished sausage.
  - When you are ready to grind, put the meat in the freezer until it is between
    30°F and 40°F. Put your grinder parts (auger, dies, blades, etc) in the
    freezer, too, and put a bowl in the fridge.
  - Grind one-half of the mixture through the coarse die on your grinder, and
    half through the fine die. This creates a more interesting texture.
  - Once the meat is cold, put it in a large bin or bowl and add the sugar,
    vinegar and brandy. Mix well with your (very clean) hands for 2 to 3 minutes
    — a good indicator of temperature is that your hands should ache with cold
    when you do this.
  - You now have boerewors. Most people stuff this into long coils of about 1 to
    2 pounds each. Stuffing sausage is easier with two people, one to fill the
    links, the other to coil, but I do it solo all the time.
  - Stuff the links well but not super-tight, as you will not be able to tie
    them off later if they are too full. Don’t worry about air pockets yet.
  - Tie off one end of the coil. Gently compress the sausage in the casing from
    the other end. Look for air pockets. To remove them, set a large needle or a
    sausage pricker into a stovetop burner until it glows (this sterilizes it),
    then pierce the casing at the air pockets.
  - Tie off the other end of the coil and repeat with the rest of the sausage.
  - Set your coil on a rack for an hour or so to dry. You can do this overnight
    in a fridge if you want. Once dried a bit, the boerewors can be refrigerated
    for up to a week, or frozen for up to a year.
