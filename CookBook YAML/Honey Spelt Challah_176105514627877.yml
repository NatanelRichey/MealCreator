notes: >-
  Last time I made this 

  I didn’t put honey and vanilla and I reduced the sugar to half a cup each. It
  was good 

  next time try with honey and check if it’s not too sweet.

  - Dough
  - Honey
ingredients:
  - 2 heaping tbsp yeast
  - ½ cup sugar
  - 800 ml of warm water approx
  - 1 cup oil
  - 4 eggs
  - 1 tbsp vanilla extract
  - ½ cup honey
  - ½ cup sugar
  - 2 tbsp salt
  - 2 kilo + 2-3 c flour, depending on how humid your kitchen is you may need
    more or less. The more humid, the more flour.
directions:
  - "Challah:"
  - In a very large bowl, or the bowl of your mixer, add yeast sugar and warm
    water.
  - Set aside and allow yeast to bloom for 8 minutes.
  - While yeast is blooming, combine oil, eggs, sugar, honey and vanilla.
  - Mix well.
  - When yeast mixture is very bubbly, pour in oil mixture. Stir.
  - Add a little less than half the bag of flour (or 1, 1 kilo bag) to the bowl.
  - Turn the mixer on low or using a spoon, mix the flour into the liquid very
    well.
  - Mix for a good 2-3 minutes to help the gluten start to develop.
  - Add salt.
  - Mix till incorporated.
  - Add in 3/4 of the flour that's left in the bag or the second 1 kilo bag of
    flour + additional 2 cups and mix.
  - If not using a machine, mix with a spoon until it becomes too hard to mix.
    At this point pour dough out onto your counter.
  - Knead for 8-10 minutes, either in the machine or by hand working in the
    remaining 1 cup of flour as needed.
  - Once dough is smooth and elastic, place back into the bowl or transfer out
    of your mixer into a lightly oiled bowl to rise.
  - Pour a little bit of oil into your hand and rub all over the dough.
  - Place a piece of saran wrap directly on dough and cover the bowl with a
    towel.
  - Allow to rise until it has at least doubled in size and then remove Saran
    Wrap, punch down, replace Saran Wrap and let it rise again.
  - (You can repeat this steps as many times as you need until you are ready to
    braid the dough.)
  - Braid your dough, place on sheet pan or in a tin and cover with a towel.
  - Let them rise for 45 minutes to an hour. (Don't skip this step.)
  - Preheat oven to 180 c. (For circle challahs I lower the oven to 175c)
  - Brush challah with beaten egg and top as you like.
  - Bake for 25-45 minutes until challahs are deeply golden and cooked.
  - Remove pan from the oven, and allow to cool for 5 minutes.
  - Transfer challahs to a cooling rack and allow to cool completely.
  - "TIPS:"
  - 1. Use a 4 c measuring cup to measure your water that also has a 3/4 c
    measure on it. After you pour out the water, measure your oil and add the
    rest of your ingredients to the cup. No need to dirty another bowl!
  - 2. The more you knead the dough the smoother and more elastic the dough will
    become. Be patient. If after 7 or 8 minutes of kneading the dough feels very
    dry or too sticky add a drop more water or flour. Just remember you can
    always add but you can't take out!
  - 3. Make sure the all the dough is covered with the Saran Wrap to prevent air
    from drying it out.
  - 4. I like to let my dough rise a few times for a fluffier challah. Let it
    rise completely, punch it down and then let it rise again. Do this at least
    one time, and up to three or four times!
