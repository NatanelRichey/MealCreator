    parsley into mixture. Spoon mixture evenly into eight 16-oz. ramekins. Place
    ramekins on a baking sheet.
  - Bake 30 minutes. Garnish with the reserved 1 tablespoon parsley.
  - To store, let casseroles cool to room temperature; cover tightly with
    plastic wrap. Store in the refrigerator up to 3 days or freeze up to 1
    month. Thaw at least 2 hours in the refrigerator. Bake, uncovered, in a
    350°F oven about 20 minutes or until heated through.
