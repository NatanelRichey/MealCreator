name: Soft Cut-Out Sugar Cookies
description: With crisp edges, thick centers, and room for lots of decorating
  icing, I know you'll love these soft sugar cookies as much as I do. The number
  of cookies this recipe yields depends on the size of the cookie cutter you
  use. If you'd like to make dozens of cookies for a large crowd, double the
  recipe.

ingredients:
  - 2.25 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed for rolling and work
    surface, 281g, spooned & leveled
  - 0.5 teaspoon baking powder
  - 0.25 teaspoon salt
  - 0.75 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature, 170g
  - 0.75 cup granulated sugar, 150g
  - 1 large egg, at room temperature
  - 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
  - 0.25 or 1/2 teaspoon almond extract *, optional, but makes the flavor
    outstanding
  - 1 Royal Icing or Easy Glaze Icing, royal icing is pictured
  - Assorted sprinkles
directions:
  - ""
  - Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set
    aside.
  - In a large bowl using a handheld or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle
    attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until
    completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla, and
    almond extract (if using) and beat on high speed until combined, about 1
    minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again
    as needed to combine.
  - Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until
    combined. Dough will be a bit soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky
    for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour.
  - Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a piece of
    lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat.
    With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch
    thickness. Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out
    dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick.
  - Lightly dust one of the rolled-out doughs with flour. Place a piece of
    parchment on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the 2nd rolled-out dough
    on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at
    least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days.
  - "Once chilled, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets
    with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough
    piece from the refrigerator. If it’s sticking to the bottom, run your hand
    under it to help remove it—see me do this in the video below. Using a cookie
    cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue
    cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd piece of dough. (Note: It doesn’t
    seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps
    you re-roll.)"
  - Arrange cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes or
    until lightly browned around the edges. If your oven has hot spots, rotate
    the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the
    baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely
    before decorating.
  - Decorate the cooled cookies with royal icing or easy cookie icing. Feel free
    to tint either icing with gel food coloring. See post above for recommended
    decorating tools. No need to cover the decorated cookies as you wait for the
    icing to set. If it’s helpful, decorate the cookies directly on a baking
    sheet so you can stick the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator to help
    speed up the icing setting.
  - Enjoy cookies right away or wait until the icing sets to serve them. Once
    the icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or for sending. Plain
    or decorated cookies stay soft for about 5 days when covered tightly at room
    temperature. For longer storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days.
