    In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Season chicken with salt
    and pepper and cook,

    turning occasionally, until golden, 5 minutes. Stir

    in bell pepper and cook until just tender, 3 minutes

    more. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine

    pineapple juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, hoisin

    sauce, garlic, and jalapeño and bring to a simmer.

    Make a slurry: In a small bowl whisk together 2

    tsp. water and cornstarch until combined, then

    whisk into saucepan. Cook until thickened, about 5

    minutes. Pour sauce over chicken and let simmer 3 minutes.

    Stir in pineapple and cashews. Garnish with green onions and serve with rice
    and

    lime.
