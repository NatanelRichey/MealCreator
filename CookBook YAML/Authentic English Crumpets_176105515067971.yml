ingredients:
  - 2 cups all-purpose flour, can substitute half bread flour
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1 cup warm milk
  - 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
  - 1 teaspoon cane sugar
  - 1 cup warm water
  - 0.5 teaspoon baking soda
directions:
  - ""
  - Stir the sugar and yeast into the warm milk and let it rest for 10 minutes
    until frothy.
  - In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer combine the flour and
    salt.
  - Add the liquid to the flour mixture and stir/knead until a thick dough
    forms. If using a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment and beat the
    mixture for about 3 minutes until a thick dough forms.
  - Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and set it in a warm place for at
    least an hour or up to two to let the dough rise (it should nearly double in
    size). This stage is important for the formation of the bubbles that will
    later form the classic holes in the crumpets.
  - Dissolve the baking soda in the warm water and add it to the dough. If using
    a stand mixer, beat the batter for a minute or two. Or use an electric mixer
    to beat the batter. If some small lumps remain thatâ€™s okay. Any remaining
    lumps will dissolve during the next resting stage.
  - Cover the batter and let it rest in a warm place for at least 30 minutes.
  - Prepare the crumpet rings by greasing the inside of each rim. Lightly oil
    the frying pan.
  - Place the rings in the frying pan over medium-high heat.
  - Once the rings are hot, pour the batter into each ring until it's slightly
    more than half full.
  - Cooking time will vary depending on your stovetop and frying pan but these
    will cook for approx. 10 minutes. The batter will begin to rise and bubble
    on top.
  - After several minutes when the tops are cooked and the classic pores/holes
    are present with the bottoms lightly browned, your crumpets are done.
  - You can either remove the rings and flip the crumpets over to cook the other
    side for another minute or two until golden or remove them from the rings
    and toast the crumpets.
  - Serve the crumpets immediately slathered with butter, jam, golden syrup or
    honey.
