  - ""
  - here's how
  - Place the couscous in a large bowl and add boiling water or stock (I used
    stock, preferable for a bit more flavour). Cover the bowl with clingfilm and
    let it stand for 10 minutes.
  - Meanwhile, heat the olive oil over a medium heat and add the thinly sliced
    onion. Cook, stirring regularly, until the onion is golden and soft. Add the
    salt and cumin to the onions and stir together. Move the onions to a small
    bowl or plate and leave to cool slightly. Give your pan a wipe and toast the
    pistachios if you haven't already.
  - For the herb paste, pop all your herb paste ingredients in a food processor
    (I used a hand whizzer) and blitz until you have a lovely smooth herby pulp.
  - Uncover the couscous and briefly fluff with a fork. Stir in your herb paste,
    using your fork to continue fluffing. Add your onions, pistachios, spring
    onion, chili, and rocket then gently mix to combine. Serve at room
    temperature.
