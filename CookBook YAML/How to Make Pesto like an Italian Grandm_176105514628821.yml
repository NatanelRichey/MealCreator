ingredients:
  - 1 large bunch of basil, leaves only, washed and dried
  - 3 medium cloves of garlic
  - Â¼ cup of raw pine nuts
  - 1 roughly.75 cup Parmesan, loosely packed and freshly grated
  - 1 few tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil
directions:
  - ""
  - Chop Ingredients
  - Start chopping the garlic along with about 1/3 of the basil leaves. Once
    this is loosely chopped add more basil, chop some more, add the rest of the
    basil, chop some more. I scrape and chop, gather and chop. At this point the
    basil and garlic should be a very fine mince. Add about half the pine nuts,
    chop. Add the rest of the pine nuts, chop. Add half of the Parmesan, chop.
    Add the rest of the Parmesan, and chop. In the end you want a chop so fine
    that you can press all the ingredients into a basil "cake" - see the photo
    up above. Transfer the pesto "cake" to a small bowl (not much bigger than
    the cake).
  - Form a Paste
  - Cover the pesto "cake" with a bit of olive oil. It doesn't take much, just a
    few tablespoons. At this point, you can set the pesto aside, or place it in
    the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Just before serving, give
    the pesto a quick stir to incorporate some of the oil into the basil.
    Francesca's mom occasionally thins the pesto with a splash of pasta water
    for more coverage, but for our gnocchi this wasn't necessary.
