  - 3 tablespoons of pomegranate sauce
  - 1 teaspoon paprika

  - "Before Oven:"

directions:
  - ""
  - Remove the core of the cabbage by cutting around it (creating a pit where
    the stem was), place in a deep pot with the stem upwards, fill with boiling
    water until the cabbage is covered, cook for about 20 minutes, until it
    softens. Begin to remove the leaves (don't panic if the first leaves come
    out a little crunchy).
  - When we reached the middle of the cabbage, take it out of the pot and
    separate the leaves until you reach the inner part, where the leaves are
    small and less suitable for filling. Wait for the leaves to cool and start
    filling.
  - Chop 1 onion in a food processor with 1 peeled tomato, a handful of dill, a
    bunch of parsley and coriander. Filter liquids and mix together with meat
    and spices.
  - Prep the sauce - mix together sauce ingredients.
  - With a knife, remove the hard part in the center of the leaf. Place the leaf
    on a work surface, take a spoonful of the filling mixture and place it on
    the wide end of the leaf, tighten and close half a turn, insert the the
    edges in, and roll.
  - Grease a pot or pan, place the stuffed cabbage with the closure facing down.
    Brush the stuffed with the sauce, making sure the sauce gets into the
    corners.
  - Pour water around the stuffed, the water should reach the height of the
    cabbage, if necessary add more water. Sprinkle a little more silan and
    pomegranate sauce, cover with baking paper and foil/lid.
  - Put in an oven preheated to 180 degrees for an hour and a half. Open the pot
    and moisten the stuffed with the sauce. If there is no sauce left, pour 1/3
    cup of boiling water to the bottom of the pot (not on the cabbage), increase
    to 200 degrees and leave open until a beautiful brown shade is obtained.
