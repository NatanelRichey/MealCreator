  - "Step 0 - Recipe:"
  - >-
    many recipes exist. important ingredients are salt (2%), curing salt
    (0.25%), a binder in coarse ground sausages (5%) and water/juice/beer
    (5-10%), spices (1-1.5%), sautéed veggies (onions, chillies) can be used too


    there will be about 15% weight loss, so 1kg of meat will yield about 850g of
    cooked sausage
  - "Step 1 - Grinding:"
  - |-
    keep meat cold at all times!
    70%-30% meat to fat ratio
    use lean meat and “hard fat”
    cut to really small pieces to ease grinding
    take out hard sinewy pieces
  - >-
    for franks/hot-dogs/weiners - grind 2 or 3 times in small grinder pieces,
    then mix in mixer until mousse texture and completely emulsified


    for sausages - use coarse grind and emulsify by hand/mixer (but not mousse
    texture)
  - "Step 2 - Stuffing:"
  - >-
    still keep meat cold!

    approx 2m of casing to 1kg of sausage meat

    pound meat into stuffer to avoid air bubbles - your worst enemy!

    load as much into the link as possible before it tears to have a crisp
    sausage

    linking while stuffing also reduces air bubbles - your worst enemy!!

    tie with double loop and double knot to prevent unravelling of links - keep
    on until the end
  - "Step 3 - Curing (essential in a cold smoke!!!):"
  - when cold smoking, temperatures are low and meat is at risk, so curing salt
    (sodium nitrate) must be added and given at least 12hrs to disperse into
    meat and reduce risk of botulism
  - "Step 4 - Drying:"
  - |-
    important to dry-out ties and for a higher casing and crisper sausage
    dry at room temp in front of a fan for about 1hr
  - "Step 5 - Cold Smoke:"
  - >-
    use pellets and smoke tube and smoke from 2-5hrs at temperature between
    30c-65c (lower the better)

    can be smoked in any box thats covered, with 2 conditions:

    1. there must be an airflow or the smoke will stale

    2. ⁠meat shouldn’t be touching other meat and better be raised of a flat
    surface (drying rack) and even better be hang smoked (special ceiling ties
    work well)

    smoke will give the meat a darker color, a smoky flavor from the wood
    (hickory is a stronger wood then apple or cherry) and will also further
    dry-out the sausage and give a firmer casing
  - "Step 6 - Pre-cook Sausage:"
  - >-
    do not boil collagen, either back of bbq on low, or in oven for 3hrs on
    80-100c

    sausage should reach an inner temp of 65c-70c and in a cold smoke it
    generally doesn’t, so sausage can be cooked in a water bath after smoking.
    this cleans the sausages and cooks them through.

    do not cook at a higher temperature!! this will cause the fat to drip and
    the sausage to shrivel and taste mealy
  - "Step 7 - Cool:"
  - >-
    to stop the sausage from overcooking and to keep them juicy, drop them in an
    ice-bath as they come out the water-bath for about 10mins.

    I skipped this step and they were still great
  - "Step 8 - Bloom:"
  - dry and cure at room temperature for 2-3 hours to get a deeper color
  - "Step 9 - Package and Store:"
  - sausages are now ready to store in ziplock and freeze. fridge for 3-4
    days,  freeze for 3 months.
  - >-
    Step 10 - Cook and Enjoy!

    sausages can be cooked with method of choice. Always cook at lower
    temperature or fat will leak (chicken fate renders at 21c!) franks tend to
    be boiled/steamed and sausages can be fried or grilled.
