ingredients:
  - 3 cups raw corn kernels, from about 4 cobs
  - 1 medium tomato (chopped, about.5 cup
  - ¾ cup chopped green onion
  - 1 cup quartered and thinly sliced cucumber, preferably English cucumber
  - ½ cup chopped fresh leafy herbs (choose from basil, dill, mint, parsley
    and/or cilantro
  - ½ cup chopped radishes
  - 1 medium jalapeño (very thinly sliced, omit if sensitive to spice
  - ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar or white wine vinegar, to taste
  - 2 medium cloves garlic, pressed or minced
  - ½ teaspoon fine sea salt, to taste
  - Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
  - ⅓ cup crumbled feta cheese or 1 ripe avocado, diced
directions:
  - ""
  - In a large serving bowl, combine the corn, tomato, green onion, cucumber,
    herbs (don't skimp on the herbs!), radishes, and jalapeño.
  - In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, combine the olive oil, vinegar,
    garlic, salt and several twists of black pepper. Whisk until blended, then
    pour it over the salad. Toss to combine.
  - Add most of the feta or avocado (reserve some for garnish), and gently toss.
    Taste, and add more vinegar for more tang (I usually add another full
    tablespoon), or salt for more overall flavor. Garnish with the remaining
    feta or avocado.
  - Serve promptly, or chill for later. This salad keeps well for 3 to 4 days in
    the refrigerator, covered.
