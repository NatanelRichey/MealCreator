name: French Toast With Orange Yoghurt
description: |-
  Having sold the Super French toast which appeared in Yotam's Plenty
  More as pretty much the definitive word on the matter, we momentarily
  questioned the inclusion of another French toast recipe here. It's such a
  brunch favourite of our NOPI regulars, though, that we weren't allowed
  to leave it out.

ingredients:
  - "Orange yoghurt:"
  - 1 finely grated zest of half an orange
  - 150 g Greek yoghurt
  - 1 tbsp orange juice
  - 1 tbsp icing sugar
  - "Mixed berries:"
  - 300 g mixed frozen berries
  - 70 g caster sugar
  - 2 tsp lemon juice
  - "Star anise sugar:"
  - 8 whole star anise, blitzed in a spice grinder until fine
  - 50 g caster sugar
  - "French toast:"
  - 5 eggs
  - 200 ml full-fat milk
  - 400 g brioche loaf (ends trimmed) cut into 6 slices, 3cm thick
  - 80 g unsalted butter (fridge-cold) cut into 2 cm dice
directions:
  - ""
  - Fold together all the ingredients for the orange yoghurt in a small mixing
    bowl and keep in the fridge, covered, until required.
  - "Place the berries in a medium saucepan with the sugar and lemon juice.
    Place on a high heat and cook for 6 minutes, stirring from time to time,
    until the sugar has dissolved and the compote is shiny and thick. Remove
    from the heat and set aside for an hour to come to room temperature: the
    compote will thicken slightly."
  - Mix together the star anise and sugar, then spread out on a small plate -
    ready for the toast to get dusted - and set aside.
  - "Place the eggs in a medium bowl and whisk well until pale, light and
    fluffy. Continue to whisk as you slowly pour in the milk, then transfer to a
    dish which is large enough to fit the 6 slices of brioche lying flat and not
    overlapping: use two dishes if you need to. Add the brioche slices and set
    aside for 5 minutes, turning them once or twice. It will seem like a lot of
    liquid for the bread to absorb, but it will careful when you are turning it,
    as it gets very soft. Preheat the oven to 240°C/220°C fan/gas mark"
  - Place a large non-stick pan on a medium. with 20g of butter. When the butter
    starts to foam, lay 3 pieces of brioche in the pan and fry to minutes. Flip
    the toast over, add 20g more butter to the pan and continue to fry for
    another 11/2 minut until golden-brown on both sides. Remove from the pan and
    set aside on a medium oven tray while you wipe the pan with some kitchen
    paper and repeat with the remaining brioche and butter. Once all the brioche
    is on the tray, transfer to the oven and bake for a final 4 minutes, until
    the toast has puffed up and is golden-brown. Remove from the oven and dip
    the brioche slices in the star anise sugar one at a time, flipping so that
    both sides get coated.
  - Serve at once, with the berry compote alongside and the orange yoghurt
    spooned on top.
