  Personal notes;

  The chocolate chips very much ruined the recipe for me. Next time I would
  totally omit the chocolate chips and sprinkle just a few on top when they come
  out the oven. 

  Secondly the base I would change the Oreos  pretzel ration and add more
  pretzels

ingredients:
  - "For the crumb base:"
  - 50 g oz. pretzels
  - 100 g/37 oz. Oreo cookies
  - 70 g tablespoons butter, melted
  - "For the filling:"
  - 250 g (generous 1 cup) cream cheese
  - 250 g (generous 1 cup) ricotta
  - 2 small eggs
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste
  - 200 g (scant 1 cup) condensed milk
  - 200 g chocolate chunks
  - 12 hole loose-based mini cheesecake
  - 1 pan, greased
directions:
  - ""
  - Preheat the oven to 170°C (325°F) Gas
  - To make the bases, crush the Oreos and pretzels to very fine crumbs in a
    food processor or place in a clean plastic bag and bash with a rolling pin.
    Transfer the crumbs to a mixing bowl and stir in the melted butter. Put a
    spoonful of the crumbs into each hole of the prepared pan and press down
    firmly using the end of a rolling pin or the back of a small spoon.
  - For the filling, whisk together the cream cheese and ricotta in a large
    mixing bowl. Add the eggs, vanilla bean paste and condensed milk and whisk
    again until smooth, then stir in three quarters of the chocolate chips.
  - Pour the filling mixture into the 12 holes of the pan leaving a little space
    in each hole as the cheesecakes will expand slightly during cooking.
    (Depending on the size of your pan, you may not need all of the mixture.)
    Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes until set with a slight wobble.
    Sprinkle over the remaining chocolate chips straight away so that they melt
    slightly on the warm cheesecakes, then leave to cool. Once cool, remove from
    the pan and chill in the refrigerator for 3 hours before serving.
