  - Base; In a food processor with the "S" blade, blend the nuts till fine.
  - Then add the in the nut butter and honey. Blend again till it comes together.
  - You should be able to press it together with your hands and it'll hold it
    shape.
  - Press into a parchment lined long thin loaf pan. I prefer to keep the crust
    thin. If you have extra use it to make caramel cups and press into a small
    cupcake liner. Alternatively you can use a larger pan.

    base.
  - Chocolate ganache topping; Blend or mix with a spoon. Add more water if
    needed to thin about 1-3 tbsp
  - Pour and spread over the caramel.
  - Place in the freezer to firm up.
  - Before serving sprinkle corde salt and press it in just a bit to stick on.
  - Cut into slice and enjoy!
  - Store one freezer.
